In this transfer learning case, I have created my own database of some animal images (such as tiger, snow leopard, leopard & elephant) and trained the dataset with help of tensorflow mobilenet V2 model for image classification. 
The mobilenet model has been pre-trained over millions of images. I have used the same feature vector to train my database. CNN (convoluted neural network) along with Max Pooling has been used in the feature vector training.
